### Project Title
Explore US bikeshare data

### Description
In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Getting Started
This program is structured in 2  steps.
1 - The user selects  the filters that are going to be  applied to the database.
2 - The user chooses the statistics to  calculate, based on the available  filtered data.

### Files used
The required files for running this program are:

* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv
